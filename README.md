# WebVR-video-360
I made a crreation.js script so that WebVR boilerplate can display video inside a sphere.
Don't be shy to tell me where i might be going wrong.
Great thanks to the Google Cardboard team and mr.doob for the files they provided in boilerplate,
also shout out to tomcat93 for the insight on the WebGL and Geometry.
